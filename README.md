# Next.js 15 App Build Failure: Missing Export in Module

This repository demonstrates a build failure in a Next.js 15 application caused by an incorrect import statement referencing a missing export in another module.  The `pages/about.js` attempts to import a non-existent export from `pages/index.js` leading to a build-time error.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Observe the build failure.

## Solution

The solution involves either:

* **Correcting the import**: Update the import statement in `pages/about.js` to import an existing export from `pages/index.js`.
* **Adding the export**: Add the export to `pages/index.js` that is being referenced in `pages/about.js`.
* **Remove the unnecessary import:** If the import is not actually needed, remove the import statement from `pages/about.js`

The solution file demonstrates how to remove the faulty import.
